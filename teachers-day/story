One day, the king of Neverland came to visit the grand island of 1 Faulix. 
He said, " What a majestic island, I shall be the leader of this land." 
After that, he inserted a sword to the highest mountain of the island. 
The proclaimed king of 1 Faulix Island went on to find shelter to spend his night in. 
On his way to the stream, he saw a group of tribal people dressed in yellow and blue costume, each with a sword in their hand. 
"Who are you human"
